Hello, this is my website.

This is a very nice website, has a functioning structure and is already visually intuitive. 

Work on the website and update it as you go. It might come in handy later on when you want to show case your expertise and skills. 

One suggestion is to store all images inside one designated sub-folder, for example, the "img" one that is already available. The data inside a designated sub-folder too, like "data" that is already available.
